# Digital Modulation Lab

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of digital modulations.

## Features

- 2-PSK Modulation (with optional random phase)
- Matched filter implementation
- Signal and matched filter output visualization
- Q-function implementation using erfc
- Q⁻¹-function (inverse Q-function) via iterative method
- Error probability vs. Bit Energy (E_b) log-log plot
- Error probability vs. SNR plot (2-PSK)
- Logarithmic sampling using logspace
- Numerical verification of Q and Q⁻¹

## Getting Started
